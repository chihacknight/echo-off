# echo-off
An online guide for cultivating small, respectful groups with differing political views

> Opinions are not changed by facts, they are changed by relationships. 
  -- overheard (and paraphrased) at the hack night.

## What is this?

The 2016 presidential election has brought to light just how easy it is for citizens of all political stripes to surround themselves with those who share and reinforce their beliefs. This creates extreme resentment and toxicity and stands in the way of real, constructive debate. 

This site will be an online guide for those who seek to understand their fellow citizens, and who are willing to step out of the echo chamber and build relationships with those who don't share political views but share a genuine desire to understand.

## Details

We are still in the very early stages of planning this thing. The work in progress can be found in this repository's [wiki][wiki]. [Contact us][contact] or [come to a hack night][hack-night] if you're interested in participating.
